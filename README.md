commandes :
lp -- lists the running processes on the machine
clear -- clears the console
exec (path-to-program) -- runs a program from PATH variables or direct path
bing (-k|-p|-c) (process_id) -- -k kills select process -p pauses and -c resumes
dir -- displays the files and folders in the current directory
cd (directory) -- navigate through directories
exit -- exit the CLI. Shift+P also works

```
